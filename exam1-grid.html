        <h2>Dart Programming Language</h2>
        <blockquote>Dart is a general-purpose programming language originally developed by Google and later approved
            as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-408). It is used to build web, server, and mobile applications. Dart is an
            object-oriented, class defined language using a C-style syntax that transcompiles optionally into JavaScript.
            It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, static typing, and a sound type system.

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes
            called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural
            intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined as the study
            of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its
            chance of successfully achieving its goals.

        <h2>Quantum Technology</h2>
        <blockquote class="item2" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_technology">Quantum technology is a new
            field of physics and engineering, which transitions some of the properties of quantum mechanics, especially
            quantum entanglement, quantum superposition and quantum tunnelling, into practical applications such as
            quantum computing, quantum sensors, quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, quantum metrology and quantum
            imaging.
